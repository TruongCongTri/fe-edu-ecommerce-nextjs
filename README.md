## ‚ùì Why Next.js (Without TypeScript)

### Why Next.js?

Next.js offers a robust framework for building React applications with features like:

- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)** and **Static Site Generation (SSG)**
- **API Routes** for backend functionality
- **Optimized performance** with automatic code splitting
- **Built-in routing** and **image optimization**

These features make Next.js an excellent choice for developing modern web applications.

### Why Not TypeScript?

While TypeScript provides static typing and can enhance code quality, this project opts for JavaScript to:

- **Reduce complexity** for demonstration purposes
- **Lower the learning curve** for developers new to TypeScript
- **Focus on showcasing Next.js features** without additional overhead

This decision aims to keep the project accessible and straightforward.
